# An important concept to understand here is the consumer group which give us the following consumer properties:
# msg   -> consumer
#
# msg:1 -> cg-userSignUp.1
# msg:2 -> cg-userSignUp.2
# msg:3 -> cg-userSignUp.3
# msg:4 -> cg-userSignUp.1
# msg:5 -> cg-userSignUp.2
# msg:6 -> cg-userSignUp.3
# msg:7 -> cg-userSignUp.1
#
# Which basically means that inside a group a single consumer will only get message the others have not yet seen.
# For a deep dive read to this -> https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
# This allows us to create N consumers w/o needing to figure out which message already has been processed.
