    This library is what came out of creating a distributed service architecture for one of our products.
    Telstar makes it easy to write consumer groups and producers against Redis streams.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

To run our distributed architecture at [@bitspark](https://bitspark.de) we needed a way to produce and consume messages with an exactly-once delivery design.
We think that, by packing up our assumptions into a separate library, we can make it easy for other services to adhere to our initial design and/or comply with future changes.

Another aspect of open-sourcing this library is that we have not found a package that does what we needed. And as we use OSS in many critical parts of our infrastructure, we wanted to give back this project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need `python >= 3.6` as we use type annotations and a running `Redis` server with at least version `>= 5.0`.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
Install everything using `pip.`

```bash
pip install telstar
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

This package comes with an end to end test, which simulates
a scenario with all sorts of failures that can occur during operation. Here is how to run the tests.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Bitspark/telstar.git
pip install -r requirements.txt

./telstar/tests/test_telstar.sh
pytest --ignore=telstar/
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This package uses consumer groups and Redis streams as a backend to deliver messages exactly once. To understand Redis streams and what the `Consumer` can do for you to read go and read [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/topics/)

### The Producer - how to get data into the system

Create a producer in our case this produces a different message with the same data every .5 seconds

```python
import Redis
import os
from uuid import uuid4
from time import sleep

from telstar.producer import Producer
from telstar.com import Message

link = redis.from_url("redis://")

def producer_fn():
    topic = "userSignedUp"
    uuid = uuid4() # Based on this value the system deduplicates messages
    data = dict(email="test1@example.com", field="value")
    msgs = [Message(topic, uuid, data)]

    def done():
        # Do something after all messages have been sent.
        sleep(.5)
    return msgs, done

Producer(link, producer_fn, context_callable=None).run()
```

Start the producer with the following command.

```bash
python producer.py
```

### The Consumer - how to get data out of the system

Now let's create consumer

```python
import Redis
import telstar

from marshmallow import EXCLUDE, Schema, fields

redis = redis.from_url("redis://")
consumer_name = "local.dev"

app = telstar.app(redis, consumer_name=consumer_name, block=20 * 1000)


class UserSchema(Schema):
    email = fields.Email(required=True)

    class Meta:
        unknown = EXCLUDE


@app.consumer("mygroup", ["userSignedUp"], schema=UserSchema, strict=True, acknowledge_invalid=False)
def consumer(record: dict):
    print(record)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.start()
```

Now start the consumer as follows:

```bash
python consumer.py
```

You should see output like the following.

```bash
{"email": "test1@example.com"}
{"email": "test1@example.com"}
{"email": "test1@example.com"}
```

Until the stream is exhausted.


## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

We currently use Kubernetes to deploy our producers and consumers as simple jobs, which, of course, is a bit suboptimal. It would be better to deploy them as a replica set.
