    This library is what came out of creating a distributed service architecture for one of our products.
    Telstar makes it easy to write consumer groups and producers against redis streams.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In order to run our distributed architecture we needed a way to receive and produces messages with a an almost exactly once delivery design.
We think that by packing up our assumptions into a seperated lib we make easy for other service to adhere to our intial design and/or comply to future changes.

Another aspect why we put this is out is, that we have not found a package that does what we needed. And as we ourselves use quite a lot OSS we wanted to give back this project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You will need `python >= 3.6` as we use type annotations and a running `redis` server with at least version `>= 5.0`.

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
Install everything using `pip`

```
pip install telstar
```

#### The Producer - how to get data into the system

Create a producer in our case this produces different message with the same data every .5 seconds
```python
import redis
import os
from uuid import uuid4
from time import sleep

from telstar.producer import Producer
from telstar.com import Message

link = redis.from_url(os.environ["REDIS"])

def producer_fn():
    topic = "mytopic"
    uuid = uuid4() # Based on this value the system deduplicates messages
    data = dict(key="value")
    msgs = [Message(topic, uuid, data)]

    def done():
        # Do something after all messages have been sent.
        sleep(.5)
    return msgs, done

Producer(link, producer_fn, context_callable=None).run()
```
Start the producer with the following command

```bash
REDIS=redis:// python producer.py
```

#### The Consumer - how to get data out of the system
Now lets creates consumer

```python
import redis
from telstar.consumer import Consumer



link = redis.from_url(os.environ["REDIS"])

def consumer(consumer, record, done):
    print(record.__dict__)
    done() # You need to call done otherwise we will get the same message over and over again

Consumer(link=link, group_name="mygroup", consumer_name="consumer-1",
         config={"mystream": consumer}).run()

```

Now start the consumer as follows:
```bash
REDIS=redis:// python consumer.py
```
You should see output like the following
```bash
{'stream': 'telstar:stream:mytopic', 'msg_uuid': b'64357230-8ff3-4eb9-8c06-757a42e961e2', 'data': {'key': 'value'}}
{'stream': 'telstar:stream:mytopic', 'msg_uuid': b'a2443ae2-549e-49ab-9256-3f13575ba6ae', 'data': {'key': 'value'}}
{'stream': 'telstar:stream:mytopic', 'msg_uuid': b'1c1d9f8c-e37b-43be-bab2-45caa10f233d', 'data': {'key': 'value'}}
{'stream': 'telstar:stream:mytopic', 'msg_uuid': b'5da942ab-4aec-4a7f-bd93-a97168a8d3ad', 'data': {'key': 'value'}}
```
Until the stream is exhausted.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
This package comes with an end to end test which simulates
a scenario with all sorts of failures that can occur during operation. Here is how to run the tests.

```
git clone git@github.com:Bitspark/telstar.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
./telstar/tests/test_telstar.sh
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
This package uses consumer groups and redis streams as a backend to deliver messages exactly once. In order to understand redis streams and what the `Consumer` can do for you to read -> https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
We currently use Kubernetes to deploy our produces and consumers as simple jobs, which of course is a bit suboptimal, it would be better to deploy them as replica set.
